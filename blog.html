                        <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
                        <p>Intellectual Property (IP) is a mechanism that makes it possible for mobile application developers 
                            and publishers to gain more income from their products. A business owner must preserve the company's 
                            intellectual property (IP) assets, such as its name, product, and trade secrets, to maintain a competitive 
                            advantage. Intellectual property is essential for most firms and serves as a tool for creativity, 
                            innovation, and development. By safeguarding the intellectual property, the owner and the company 
                            may obtain a competitive edge in the marketplace.</p>
                            <h4>Purpose of having the intellectual property</h4>
                            <p>As the popularity of the industry is increasing extensively and the level of competition is high, 
                                mobile app developers must be able to secure their work via intellectual property legislation to prevent 
                                others from infringing and benefitting from their work. Without this security, developers would be 
                                unable to regulate the quality of their apps and assure correct attribution.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Intellectual property types and strategies</h4>
                        <p>Patents, trademarks, and copyrights are the three primary types of protection accessible to mobile app developers.</p>
                        <p><b>Patents</b>  give the person who owns them the right to make and sell the invention for up to twenty years.</p>
                        <p>A <b>trademark</b>is usually used to protect a word, a name, a logo, a symbol, a device, or a combination of these elements. 
                            Trademarks are used in branding by businesses, companies, and entrepreneurs to enable customers to recognize their 
                            products or services. Prospective consumers may use trademarks to determine the reputation of a seller of products 
                            or a supplier of services.
                            <p>A <b>copyright</b> is a legal term that refers to the protection of creative works such as literature, music, cinema, 
                            and software. Copyright protection ensures that the owner of the work retains the exclusive right to copy and 
                            distribute copies, as well as to perform or exhibit the work publicly.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Inbound licensing of intellectual property</h4>
                            <p>Inbound licensing is also known as "licensing in" or "in-licensing" when it comes to. 
                                When party licenses in intellectual property owned by another party in an inbound transaction, 
                                the roles are reversed, and the licensed party acquires the position of the licensee.</p>
